# drawERD

Welcome to drawERD - A fully local Entity Relations Diagram (ERD) drawing tool.

_PS: Its made in svelte <3_

## Project Status

This project is still in development. Its not in a real usable state. Some major features that are still missing are:
- [ ] Enums
- [ ] Data Relations
- [ ] Exporter
- [ ] True canvas intractability
- [ ] Landing Page
- [ ] Various bugs

## Info

### Is this _really_ an ERD drawer?

AFAIK, its actually not. Its actually more of a Data Structure Diagram (DSD), or a United Modeling Language (UML) structure diagram. ERD is just the more well known name for all db-related diagrams
